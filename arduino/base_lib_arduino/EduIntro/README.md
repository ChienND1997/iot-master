# Education Introduction Library - a.k.a. EduIntro

## Library for the Arduino Education Introduction Workshop

Arduino library for short introduction workshops ran by Arduino Education. This library, based on the original one made for the TinkerKit, simplifies the use of sensors and actuators when connected to an Arduino board. The goal is to run simple 1 or 2h workshops where users will still get the opportunity to design meaningful interactions using discrete electronic components.

## From version 0.0.6 - Extra sensor: DHT11

20190209 - For a course at Aalborg University, CPH, we added the humidity and temperature sensor DHT11, the LM35 temperature sensor, a PIR sensor, and a couple more examples to the courseware.

## From version 0.0.5 - Added support for Arduino MKR boards

20190126 - Sabas came all the way from Mexico to Malmo and made a fresh pull request. Now the library works with MKR boards!

## From version 0.0.4 - Added Cardboard Keyboard Workshop material
